questions, 
	1. will they produce agrement ID? if yes is that agrement made for only one item or for all the pawning item?
	2. need to see a remind letter. if there are many need to see all of them.
	3. did we keep any guarantor for this pawned item? No
	4. is there any default charge? if so how much and when is the limit? 
	5. get EPF account details what details are required and how are they working?
	6. storing the golds?

10/15/2023
	7. how the interest will be calculated for a gold?

operations, 
	1. make reminders for new employees to create a new EPF or ETF account to the owner of the comapny or to the HR. because within 14 days it is required to open a new EPF account to the employee by the employer of the company.
	2. if a customer already signed a bill no one can change the bill details again 
	3. no agrement can change after approval. 
	4. derived attributes need to be added. they are not added.
	5. in EPF/ETF table you can add a trigger. because isSigned attribute only can be signed by the related user of the organization. and also he or she cannot change the changed status later.
